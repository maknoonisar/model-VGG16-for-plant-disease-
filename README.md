# Plant Disease Detection with VGG16

## 🌿 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to utilize advanced deep learning techniques to detect plant diseases effectively.

## 🌱 Significance
Early and precise detection of plant diseases can greatly influence crop productivity, making this project vital for the agricultural sector.

## 🧠 Model Overview
This project employs the VGG16 deep learning architecture, a well-established model known for its excellence in image classification tasks.

## 📦 Dataset
The project uses the comprehensive New Plant Diseases Dataset, which offers a wide variety of plant images for both training and validation. Access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/data).

## 📊 Performance
Our model has achieved significant accuracy on the test set, though there is always room for improvement.

## 🔍 Enhancement Strategies
We are confident that accuracy can be further improved through the following methods:
- **Increased Epochs:** Prolonging the training period can help the model learn more detailed patterns in the plant images.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rates and batch sizes can lead to better performance.
- **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like data augmentation can diversify the dataset, improving the model's generalization capabilities.
- **Advanced Architectures:** Investigating more sophisticated deep learning architectures may yield even higher accuracy.
