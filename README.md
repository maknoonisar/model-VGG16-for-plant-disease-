Project Objective
The aim of this project is to detect plant diseases using deep learning techniques, specifically the VGG16 model. Early detection of plant diseases is crucial as it can significantly impact crop yields and overall agricultural productivity.

Importance
Accurate and timely diagnosis of plant diseases can help farmers take necessary actions to protect their crops, thereby ensuring better yield and quality. This can lead to increased food security and economic stability in agricultural communities.

Model Overview
The VGG16 model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that has proven effective for image classification tasks. It consists of 16 layers with weights, which makes it deep enough to learn intricate features from images, making it suitable for detecting various plant diseases.

Dataset
The project uses the New Plant Diseases Dataset, which contains a diverse collection of images of healthy and diseased plants. This dataset is crucial for training the model to recognize different plant diseases accurately.

Performance and Continuous Improvement
While the model has achieved notable accuracy, there are several strategies to further enhance its performance:

More Epochs: Training the model for more epochs can help it learn better from the data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and dropout rates can improve the model's performance.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, zooming, and flipping can create more diverse training samples, helping the model generalize better.
Advanced Architectures: Exploring newer architectures or combining models can potentially improve accuracy.
Usage
The repository includes Jupyter notebooks for the following:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
Model Training: Training the VGG16 model on the dataset.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance on test data.
